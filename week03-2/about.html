                    <h2>THE YALE SCHOOL OF ART IS A GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT CONFERS MASTER OF FINE ARTS DEGREES IN GRAPHIC
                        DESIGN, PAINTING/PRINTMAKING, PHOTOGRAPHY, AND SCULPTURE</h2>
                    <p>
                        Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are provided an educational
                        context in which they can explore the potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense
                        critical dialogue. This dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished visitors, and by
                        a faculty comprised of professional artists of acknowledged accomplishment.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s own
                        studio activity. Supporting this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained
                        from rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the
                        rich academic offerings found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely exposed to many
                        aesthetic positions through encounters with faculty members and visitors. The School is devoted
                        not only to the refinement of visual skills, but also to the cultivation of the mind. Students
                        must bring creative force and imagination to their own development, for these qualities cannot
                        be taught—they can only be stimulated and appreciated.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale College (see the
                        bulletin Yale College Programs of Study). In addition, the School’s courses are open to students
                        in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and other professional schools of the University,
                        and School of Art students may enroll in elective courses in the Graduate School and other
                        professional schools as well as in the College with permission.

                    <h2>MASTER OF FINE ARTS DEGREE (MFAS)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the School of Art. It is
                        conferred by the University upon recommendation of the faculty after successful completion of
                        all course work in residence and after a thesis presentation that has been approved by the
                        faculty. It implies distinctive achievement on the part of students in studies in the
                        professional area of their choice and demonstrated capacity for independent work. The minimum
                        residence requirement is two years. All candidates’ work is reviewed by faculty at the end of
                        each term. If the work is not considered satisfactory, the student may not be invited back to
                        complete the program (see section on Review and Awards under Academic Regulations in the chapter
                        General Information). All degree candidates are expected to be present at the Commencement
                        exercises in May unless excused by the dean.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Course work for the Master of Fine Arts degree carries a minimum of sixty credits. The
                        disposition of these credits varies according to the area of study and is agreed upon at the
                        time of registration between the student and the student’s faculty adviser.

                    <p>
                        Each department has its own visitors program in which professionals from outside the School are
                        invited to lecture to students or take part in critiques.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The School also facilitates a public all-school lecture program, in which ideas of general and
                        cross-disciplinary importance are explored by visiting artists and members of the faculty in
                        events typically hosted in the evening that are free and open to the public.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The School of Art’s galleries in Green Hall and EIK at 32 Edgewood Avenue provide a year-round
                        forum for the exhibition of work by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate
                        departments of the School and the undergraduate program. Green Gallery is open to the public
                        when exhibitions are scheduled, but open hours vary by semester. EIK is open during limited
                        hours for specific exhibitions and events. Please refer to the Gallery & Publications page for
                        more information.
